# AwesomeConfig
My system configs for AwesomeWM:

This config is heavily based on the configs by copycat-killer, also available on GitHib.
CopyCat-Killers original work I forked from is available in the bulk file. The reference isn't more professional because I used this config and modified it regularly for years on my own machine before making a repo for it. I don't know what I have changed and what I haven't anymore.

I am not really posting this to share, but you are welcome to it if you like. I am posting it as a convenient way to start keeping this the same across my machines, and to start developing a more system agnostic config, which it currently is not.

This config has a dependency on LAIN, which you will have to download and include if you want to use it.
